# Handwriting touchpad

Because my laptop's keyboard has been broken recently, it is not my main development machine for now. The development of handwriting touchpad is stagnated because the laptop (which has the touchpad) is always closed now.

I am planning to turn android phones (I have quite a lot of them.) into handwriting input devices for PC (with `socket` communication) which is a more ergonomic setup.

## Project ideas
