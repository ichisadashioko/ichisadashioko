# Handwriting touchpad

Because my laptop's keyboard has been broken recently, it is not my main development machine for now. The development of handwriting touchpad is stagnated because the laptop (which has the touchpad) is always closed now.

I am planning to turn android phones (I have quite a lot of them.) into handwriting input devices for PC (with `socket` communication) which is a more ergonomic setup.

# Linux driver development

I just have obtained a Google Pixel 4a which cannot connect to Wi-Fi even though I re-flashed the firmware. It can connect to the internet with `gnirehtet`. However, Google does not allow me to setup the device without Wi-Fi connection. Because of that, I am looking to develop a virtual Wi-Fi driver for android device - as a linux kernel module. `android-x86` and most android emulators had successfully implemented that so I know that it is possible to be done.

# Raspberry Pi projects

# Visual novel projects

I don't have "umlimited" free time and my own room (I moved out.) to go through each sentences to write summary and paraphrase them anymore.

## Project ideas

- Rewrite all the assets extraction tools to show preview and allow to extract only the selected assets instead of mindlessly extrating all of them.

# PS Vita

My first ever "mainstream" console (6 years after it is released - 2000 model).

## Project ideas

- Extracting PKG
